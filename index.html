        <h2>PhD Project: DEM study of the behaviour of granular materials during drained cyclic loading</h2>
          <p>
            My PhD focused on the behaviour of granular materials subjected to drained cyclic loading. 
            These conditions can be found adjacent to wind turbines with monopile foundation. 
            
            Europe is one of the leaders in the offshore wind market and Europe aims to achieve a climate-neutral, low-carbon economy by 2050. 
            One of the most expensive components of an offshore fixed-bottom (monopile) wind turbine construction is the assembly and installation of the substructure and foundation which is estimated to comprise 23.3% of the total cost in the 2021 Cost of Wind Energy Review. 
            Monopile foundations are typically 30 - 40m in length and they are vulnerable to tilt. Exceeding the design limits for tilt could lead to high repair costs and potentially compete shutdown of the structure.

              <h3>Molecular Dynamic Simulations in LAMMPS</h3>
              <p>
                I have been using an open-source molecular dynamics code called LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) to create samples up to 150k particles. 
                The particles represent sand samples and are loaded cyclically under varying conditions. 
                The samples can consist of spheres or clumps (two over lapping spheres). 
                A smaller sample of about 8k clumps is represented to the right. 
                Properties such as particle movement, contact number, stresses etc are output throughout the simulation resulting in large quantities of data to be processed. 
                The simulations are run on the Imperial College high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.

              <h3>Energy Spot Price Forecast</h3>
              <p>
                In this project, predictions for the energy spot price of a given country were made based on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind (both onshore and offshore), as well as energy demand. 
                XGBoost models were trained for different countries. 
                To prevent overfitting, the tree depth and learning rate were carefully selected to minimize the diffrence in RMSE between the training and validation set. 
                Feature engineering was performed to optimize model performance. 
                The data used in this analysis was obtained via API requests from Energy-Charts.info, using data licensed under CC BY 4.0.

              <h3>Android Game</h3>
              <h4>The Game</h4>
              <p>
                The game was created in Android Studio using Java. 
                It follows a simple concept where the main character can be moved left or right by pressing on the left or right half of the screen. 
                The goal is it to avoid the falling objects unless a hammer has been collected in which case the user can destroy the objects and collect points. 
                The falling assets are called triaxial apparatus which is an equipment used in geotechnical engineering for soil testing. 
                The background is Queens Tower which is located a Imperial College London. 
                When losing the game, the following quote appears "You got soiled".
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="work__text">
              <p>
                The main character is animated by looping through different images scaled according to screen width which are updated every few milliseconds when walking left or right. The images have been created in GIMP which is an image editor in a pixel art style. Booleans (true or false conditions) are used to determine if the character is walking or not, left or right, and if the character has collected a hammer in which case the arms get replaced by an arm holding a hammer.
                An invisible square box is placed around the character and the falling objects. If the two collide the game is either lost or a point is collected depending on if the main character is currently in possession of a hammer.

                The online Leaderboard system is connected to Google Firebase, where the data in this case the username and score and timestamp is submitted to an online database if the user wishes to do so. 
                Equally if the user wishes to view the Leaderboard the data of the first top 50 players is retrieved from Firebase.
